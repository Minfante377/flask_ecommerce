# Small-scale ecommerce using Flask

Many small entrepreurs cannot affort the comission fee from integrated and
automatic payment methods.
This very simple (and not beautiful) small scale ecommerce website was
developed to create a simple and free way for small entrepreurs to sell their
products. The client will create an order and later the entrepreur will contact
the client to arrange a payment method.

## Features
- Admin panel to create and manage products, orders and customers.
- Product catalog with a title, image, price.
- Product detailed view with description.
- Shopping cart.
- Client database.
- Orders database.

## Work in progress

- Send a telegram message or email every time a client creates an order.
- Use PostgressSQL insted of SQLite.
- Make the website not so ugly.
- Add everything needed to deploy it to Heroku.
- Add some basic UI tests using pytest and Selenium
